 * "Draw a circle with a given color, ratio, and direction."

 * The ratio is a number between 0 and 1.

 * 
 * The ratio is used to determine how much of the circle to draw. 
 * 
 * The direction is used to determine which direction to draw the circle. 
 * 
 * The ratio and direction are used to determine the end angle of the circle. 
 * 
 * The start angle is always 0. 
 * 
 * The end angle is calculated by multiplying the ratio by 2Ï€. 
 * 
 * If the direction is anti-clockwise, the end angle is multiplied by -1. 
 * 
 * The end angle is then added to the start angle. 
 * 
 * The start and end angles are then passed to the arc() method.
